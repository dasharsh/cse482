CSE 482 Final Project Music (Product) Recommendation System

This is part of my class's final project. The goal was to create a product recommendation system for music, by preprocessing data, applying various algorithms to the data, and analysing the accuracy of the algorithms applied.

Data set used for project was obtained from the yahoo music ratings website with their permission. The data is not being displayed here, only the results of the algorithms applied to the modified dataset are being shown in the various notebooks.

For some algorithms, work was utilized from existing code bases, and citations are included in the written report, and some notebooks contain links at the bottom of the notebook for reference.

Project divided into data collection, data preprocessing, application of algorithms, and accuracy analysis.

For data collection: Data set used for project was obtained from the yahoo music ratings website with their permission
For data preprocessing: Data set was modified using personally written script files in python
For application of algorithms: Work was utilized from existing code bases and modified/ altered/ added to in order to fit given dataset (links to original sources provided in notebooks and final report)
For accuracy analysis: Built in accuracy measures were implemented and new methods of measuring accuracy were created (mentioned in final report)
